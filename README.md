The installation explores an artifact of the fordist capitalist economy from the 20th century, where information was mainly processed via the medium paper. The most technological advanced machines used to translate highly on-demand information like logistic centers were matrix printers with infinite paper feed. These machines were trimmed to print as much and fast as possible. As side effect of its squeezed-to-the-max productivity, it produced an enourmous amount of noise, tried to hide.
Now erected from its former use as machinic slave to the paperwork capitalism, this technological artefact is the star of the stage, receiving an audience which formerly
It is printing a procedural live composition into the air, our current medium wherein information is distributed.
